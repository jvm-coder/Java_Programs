#Java_Programs :coffee:

Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed
to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming
language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that
compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.

Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual
machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar
to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides
dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not
available in traditional compiled languages. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular
programming languages in use according to GitHub, particularly for client-server web
applications, with a reported 9 million developers.
